# High-Fidelity Task Assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing via Implicit Human Feedback
Task assignment that allocates spatial tasks to mobile workers based on time windows has emerged as a key research problem in spatial crowdsourcing (SC), where the major challenge lies in deciding the optimal window size. Recent studies use reinforcement learning models (RLMs) to adaptively partition task streams into time windows, showing promising performance. However, most RLMs are trained in simplified digital-worlds where travel times are estimated by static rules or distances, failing to capture physical-world dynamics such as congestion and lane changes. This misalignment of travel time leads to a significant performance gap when deployed RLMs in real-world SC environments. To bridge this gap, we study a novel High-Fidelity Task Assignment (HFTA) problem and present an effective Adaptive Matching with Implicit Human Feedback (AM-IHF) framework to solve it. AM-IHF comprises three key components: 1) a high-fidelity environment equipped with a task-oriented lane-changing model that capture realistic traffic-task dynamics, 2) an RLM-powered adaptive matcher with enhanced spatiotemporal state representations, and 3) a lightweight human-in-the-loop module, which enables implicit human guidance by adjusting learning parameters (i.e., time window boundaries) via visual feedback, thus injecting domain knowledge without increasing cognitive load.
