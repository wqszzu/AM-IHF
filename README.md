# Simulation-Enhanced Adaptive Task Assignment with Human Feedback in Spatial Crowdsourcing
We investigate the problem of adaptive task assignment and establish a novel Simulation-based Human-in-the-Loop Adaptive Matching (SHLAM) framework, consisting of simulation environment, RL decision module, and human guidance module. In simulation environment (<em>see the carla folder for the code</em>), we propose a task-guided lane-changing model to simulate workers' lane-changing behavior more realistically. In RL decision module (<em>see the RL folder for the code</em>), we design a new state representation for agent to model the simulation environment, which can enhance the agent's understanding of simulation environment. In human guidance module (<em>see the system folder for the code</em>), we present a human-in-the-loop optimization mechanism to improve the learning efficiency of agent by adjusting time window limitation boundary. Furthermore, we design and develop a Human-Computer Interaction System (HCIS), a visual human-in-the-loop system that assists humans in effectively exploring, interpreting, and reasoning about the simulation environment to accurately guide the agent.
